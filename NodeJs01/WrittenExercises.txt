1. we sometimes might want to use setImmediate instead of SetTimeout if
we want the callback to run immeadiatley after IO event`s callbacks

2. process.nextTick is unique in that it is not part of the event loop,it 
is processed after current operation completes and before event loop continues(including setImmediate).
setImmediate on the other hand is part of the event loop and runs on the check phase of the event loop
after IO event`s callbacks.
